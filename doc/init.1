.SH NAME
init - the first process started by the kernel

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY init
.YS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I init
system-utility is the first process to be started by the kernel.
It mounts \fI/dev\fR, \fI/dev/pts\fR, \fI/sys\fR and \fI/proc\fR, after which it invokes the
.I /bin/sh
utility as an interactive login shell, until the
.I init
process gets a
.I SIGTERM
or
.I SIGKILL
signal, after which it calls 
.I sync()
and shuts down the machine.
The
.I init
utility may only be started with a
.I pid
of 1.
